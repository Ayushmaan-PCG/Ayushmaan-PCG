	- A Personal Note from the Instructor: 
	
		- Ayush, you have a positive attitude and are a joy to teach. You consistently put forth your best effort in class, which was wonderful to see. You are always eager to learn, and even more eager to put what you have learned into practice. Ayush, you worked hard to get the textures just right for your project - it was also great to see you putting your command block expertise to use by helping others. It was a pleasure to have you in my class. Phenomenal job this week, and have fun crafting out there.
